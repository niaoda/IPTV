How to create a localised channellist file for tv.com and create the necessary cookie file to grab data from local channels


1. In your browser goto http://www.tv.com/listings/
2. At the upper right corner of the whitish window click the button *EDIT . Enter your zip code eg 94102 for San Francisco or 60601 for Chicago, and select your provider
3. Wait for the webpage to complete.
4. Export the cookies to a file named tv.com.cookies.txt in the same folder as the config file. Follow the instructions as in http://webgrabplus.com/documentation/configuration/cookie
5. Open tv.com.ini . Near the bottom is the section that creates channelist files
	Enable the lines there by removing the first *
6. Add one dummy channel in your config 
	<channel update="i" site="tv.com" site_id="" xmltv_id="dummy">dummy</channel>
7. run wg++
8. If all is well you have created a channellist file for your location
	tv.com.channels.xml
9. Revert the actions of 5. 

Notice:  you will need the cookie file created in 4 also to grab guide data from these channels and the selected provider.

	Done
