01. in the config file define one (or more) channel(s) like below:

eg. 1 show a day:
<channel update="f" site="fixed" site_id="00:00-23:59##title:Full Day Show##subtitle:All day long##description:24h schedule##category:film#_#entertainment##presenter:me#_#myself#_#Irene####" xmltv_id="dummy001">dummy001</channel>

eg. 2 shows a day:
<channel update="f" site="fixed" site_id="00:00-12:00##title:First Show##subtitle:Half a day long##description:12h schedule (part 1)####12:00-23:59##title:Last Show##subtitle:Half a day long##description:12h schedule (part 2)" xmltv_id="dummy002">dummy002</channel>

z. 			  ####						closing tag for this show

You can create as many shows as you like / day. Just be sure that when you create a 1 day show, the start and end time are not the same. So 00:00-00:-00 will NOT work. Just make it 00:00-23:59.

FYI:
If you have many shows on a day, are want to have much details, the config line can become pretty long. In xml, you can split your lines easily like:

  <channel update="f" site="fixed" site_id="
  00:00-23:50
  ##title:Full Day Show
  ##subtitle:All day long
  ##description:24h schedule
  ####"
  xmltv_id="dummy001">dummy001</channel>
