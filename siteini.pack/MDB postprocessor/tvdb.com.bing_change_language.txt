Language customization of tvdb.com.bing.ini

This tvdb ini is a variant of tvdb.com.ini. It uses Bing as primary search engine which improves the matching result for series with very simple titles , like 'friends' or 'cops' 
It also allows the language preference of the matching in thetvdb. It will then look for series data for that prefered language first . Also it will automatically revert to English if nothing is available for that language. (Which happens a lot!!)
To set the prefered language, do the following:

1. Open for editing tvdb.com.bing.ini .
2. Have a look at the table below, it gives the language codes of the available languages in thetvdb. 
Remember the tow letter code for your language. e.g sv for Swedisch
The language number is not relevant here.
3. Locate this line:
mdb_temp_4.modify {addend|'mdb_temp_1'/all/en####} * change this line to set your prefered language!!
And change en#### into sv#### for Swedisch
4. Save tvdb.com.bing.ini , obtionally with another name , like tvdb.com.bing_sv.ini to distinguis it from the original.
In that case also change the filename in mdb.config

That's all!!
